# CheckoutProject
Creating a checkout stations and number of customer lines to calculate average waiting time, queue length...
Write a program named Checkout.java that uses queues to compare three different models for self-checkout stations at a grocery store:

One line for customers, with n checkout stations. Customers go to the next available station.
n lines for customers, with one checkout station per line. Customers go to the line with the fewest number of customers.
n lines for customers, with one checkout station per line. Customers go to a randomly chosen line.
Run each system for two hours, with a “clock” that ticks every second. At the end of the two hours, report at least these statistics:

Number of customers served
Maximum queue length
Average customer waiting time (how long it is from when they entered a queue until they are at the checkout station)
...and any other statistics that you thinking might be interesting or useful to report.

Here is the Queue.java(https://sjeccd.instructure.com/courses/45863/files/9968530/download?download_frd=1) file. You may use it as is or modify it to suit your purposes.
